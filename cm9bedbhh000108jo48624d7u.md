PowerShell has become an essential tool for managing and automating tasks in Azure. With the Az module, it's possible to work directly with Azure resources in a way that‚Äôs both scriptable and scalable.

This post covers practical PowerShell examples for automating common cloud tasks‚Äîlike starting or stopping virtual machines, filtering resources by location or status, using loops to repeat actions across multiple resources, and handling errors cleanly in scripts.

Each example is designed to highlight real-world patterns that can simplify cloud operations and help make automation scripts more reliable and flexible.  
  
**‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started with Basic PowerShell Commands for Azure**

Before diving into automation, it‚Äôs helpful to get familiar with a few core commands used to interact with Azure resources. These examples use the **Az module**, which can be installed with:

```json
powershellCopyEditInstall-Module -Name Az -Scope CurrentUser -Repository PSGallery -Force
```

After installation, log in to your Azure account:

```json
powershellCopyEditConnect-AzAccount
```

Once connected, here are some commonly used commands:

---

### üìÅ Create a Resource Group

A resource group is a container for your Azure resources. Here's how to create one using PowerShell:

```json
powershellCopyEditNew-AzResourceGroup -Name "MyResourceGroup" -Location "EastUS"
```

---

### üíª Get a List of Virtual Machines

To list all virtual machines in your subscription:

```json
powershellCopyEditGet-AzVM
```

If you only want to see the VM names:

```json
powershellCopyEditGet-AzVM | Select-Object Name
```

---

### üü¢ Start a VM

```json
powershellCopyEditStart-AzVM -Name "vm-name" -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup"
```

---

### üî¥ Stop a VM

```json
powershellCopyEditStop-AzVM -Name "vm-name" -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup"
```

---

These commands form the foundation of most PowerShell automation tasks. Once you're comfortable running them manually, it becomes easier to scale things up using loops, filtering, and error handling.

---

## üîç Filtering and Logic in PowerShell

One of the most useful parts of working with PowerShell is its ability to handle objects, not just plain text. This means you can filter Azure resources based on properties like location, status, or name‚Äîcleanly and efficiently.

Here are a few ways to apply logic when working with Azure virtual machines:

---

### üåç Filter VMs by Location

This returns only the virtual machines that are in a specific region:

```json
powershellCopyEditGet-AzVM | Where-Object { $_.Location -eq "EastUS" }
```

The `$_` refers to ‚Äúthe current object‚Äù being passed through the pipeline. This line says:

> ‚ÄúGet all the VMs, and keep only the ones where the Location equals EastUS.‚Äù

---

### ‚ö° Filter VMs That Are Running

To check the **status** of a VM (e.g. running, stopped), add the `-Status` flag:

```json
powershellCopyEditGet-AzVM -Status | Where-Object { $_.Statuses[1].Code -eq "PowerState/running" }
```

The status is returned as an array, and the **power state** is typically found at index `[1]`.

---

### üß† Combine Filters (e.g. Location + Status)

You can combine multiple conditions inside the same filter:

```json
powershellCopyEditGet-AzVM -Status | Where-Object {
    $_.Location -eq "EastUS" -and $_.Statuses[1].Code -eq "PowerState/running"
}
```

This returns only the VMs that are both *in EastUS* and currently *running*. From here, you could pass that into other commands like `Stop-AzVM`.

## üîÅ Loops and Automation with PowerShell

Once you know how to get and filter Azure resources, the next step is automating actions across multiple resources. That‚Äôs where loops‚Äîespecially `foreach`‚Äîcome in.

Here‚Äôs how to repeat actions for a list of virtual machines:

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Loop Through a List of VM Names

You can loop through a simple array of VM names like this:

```json
powershellCopyEdit$vms = @("vm1", "vm2", "vm3")

foreach ($vm in $vms) {
    Start-AzVM -Name $vm -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup"
}
```

This will attempt to start each VM in the list, one at a time.

---

### üß± Loop Through VMs with Different Resource Groups

If each VM is in a different resource group, you can store both values using an array of hashtables:

```json
powershellCopyEdit$vms = @(
    @{ Name = "vm1"; RG = "GroupA" },
    @{ Name = "vm2"; RG = "GroupB" }
)

foreach ($vm in $vms) {
    Start-AzVM -Name $vm.Name -ResourceGroupName $vm.RG
}
```

This approach makes your script more dynamic and flexible‚Äîespecially in real-world environments where naming and grouping aren‚Äôt always consistent.

---

### üßØ Add Error Handling with Try/Catch

To prevent your loop from crashing if one VM fails (for example, if it‚Äôs already running or doesn't exist), wrap the command in a `try { } catch { }` block:

```json
powershellCopyEditforeach ($vm in $vms) {
    try {
        Start-AzVM -Name $vm.Name -ResourceGroupName $vm.RG
    }
    catch {
        Write-Output "Failed to start VM: $($vm.Name)"
    }
}
```

You can also log these failures to a file:

```json
powershellCopyEdit"Failed to start VM: $($vm.Name)" | Out-File -FilePath "errors.txt" -Append
```

---

With these patterns, you can automate common cloud operations in a way that‚Äôs reliable and easy to maintain.

## üî¥ Stopping VMs Based on Region and Power State

Sometimes, you only want to stop virtual machines that are currently running‚Äîand maybe only in a specific region. This avoids unnecessary API calls and helps keep your scripts efficient and safe.

---

### üåç Stop All Running VMs in EastUS

This command filters for VMs that are:

* Located in **EastUS**
    
* Currently in the **running** state
    

Then it pipes them directly into `Stop-AzVM`:

```json
powershellCopyEditGet-AzVM -Status | Where-Object {
    $_.Location -eq "EastUS" -and $_.Statuses[1].Code -eq "PowerState/running"
} | Stop-AzVM
```

PowerShell automatically handles **parameter binding** here‚Äîit passes the VM `Name` and `ResourceGroupName` to `Stop-AzVM` behind the scenes, as long as those properties exist on the object.

---

### üßØ Optional: Add Error Handling

To safely stop VMs in a loop with error logging:

```json
powershellCopyEdit$vms = Get-AzVM -Status | Where-Object {
    $_.Location -eq "EastUS" -and $_.Statuses[1].Code -eq "PowerState/running"
}

foreach ($vm in $vms) {
    try {
        Stop-AzVM -Name $vm.Name -ResourceGroupName $vm.ResourceGroupName -Force
    }
    catch {
        "Failed to stop VM: $($vm.Name)" | Out-File -FilePath "stop-errors.txt" -Append
    }
}
```

> üîπ `-Force` is used to avoid confirmation prompts  
> üîπ Errors are logged, but the loop continues

---

With these patterns, it's easy to scale out operations across multiple VMs without writing complex logic. Filtering + looping + error handling = the core of smart PowerShell automation.

## üìù Logging and Output in PowerShell Scripts

Logging is an underrated part of automation. Whether you're running a script manually or inside a CI/CD pipeline, it's important to know **what happened**, **what failed**, and **what succeeded**‚Äîwithout staring at the terminal the whole time.

---

### üí¨ Output to the Console

During development or testing, simple console messages help trace what's happening:

```json
powershellCopyEditWrite-Output "Starting VM: $($vm.Name)"
```

Or the shorter alias:

```json
powershellCopyEdit"Starting VM: $($vm.Name)"
```

---

### üìÅ Writing to a Log File

For longer-running scripts, especially those in production or being used by others, it's better to log to a file:

```json
powershellCopyEdit"Successfully started VM: $($vm.Name)" | Out-File -FilePath "log.txt" -Append
```

You can also write errors:

```json
powershellCopyEdit"Failed to stop VM: $($vm.Name)" | Out-File -FilePath "error-log.txt" -Append
```

The `-Append` flag ensures each new line is added to the end of the file, not overwriting the previous ones.

---

### üß† Pro Tip: Timestamp Your Logs

Adding a timestamp to each log entry can make troubleshooting easier:

```json
powershellCopyEdit"$((Get-Date).ToString('u')) - Started VM: $($vm.Name)" | Out-File -FilePath "log.txt" -Append
```

This adds something like:

```json
yamlCopyEdit2025-04-10 12:43:00Z - Started VM: myVM01
```

---

Logging is especially useful when combining multiple operations in a script‚Äîlike stopping some VMs, starting others, tagging resources, or setting configurations.

## ‚úÖ Wrapping Up

PowerShell, when paired with the Az module, becomes a reliable tool for managing Azure resources through automation. Whether it's starting or stopping virtual machines, filtering resources by region or status, or handling errors and logs‚Äîthese patterns are foundational for scaling out cloud operations.

What makes PowerShell especially effective is its combination of:

* **Object-based filtering** (using `Where-Object`)
    
* **Looping through multiple resources** (`foreach`)
    
* **Built-in error handling** (`try/catch`)
    
* **Readable output and logs** (`Out-File`, timestamps, etc.)
    

These aren‚Äôt just helpful for simplifying repetitive tasks‚Äîthey also build the confidence needed to run scripts safely in production environments or as part of deployment pipelines.

### üß© What‚Äôs Next?

Here are a few great next steps you could explore from here:

* Turn these script patterns into **functions** for reuse
    
* Accept **input parameters** to make scripts more flexible
    
* Use PowerShell in **Azure DevOps pipelines**
    
* Combine with **Terraform** or **ARM templates** for hybrid deployments
    

PowerShell is not just about command-line control‚Äîit's a foundation for reliable cloud automation.
