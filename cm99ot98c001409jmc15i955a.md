**How do you safely give teams freedom in Azure—without creating chaos?  
Here’s what I’ve learned about building a “subscription vending machine” that works at scale**

## 💭 Why I Started Thinking About Subscription Vending

As more teams at my company started using Azure, we noticed a few patterns:

* Everyone wanted their *own space* to build, test, or deploy
    
* Shared subscriptions became cluttered, confusing, and impossible to manage
    
* Tags were missing, budgets weren’t enforced, and policies were applied inconsistently
    

At first, we tried to **manually** create subscriptions. But it didn’t scale—and worse, every team’s environment looked totally different.

That’s when we came across the idea of **Subscription Vending**.

---

## 🧠 What Is Subscription Vending in Azure?

Think of it like this:

> Subscription Vending is the process of **automating the creation of Azure subscriptions**—so each one comes preloaded with everything a team needs to get started safely and consistently.

Instead of clicking around in the Azure portal and setting things up by hand, we hand over a **"vending machine"**—teams make a request, and within minutes, they get a fully prepared subscription that’s:

* ✅ Secure
    
* ✅ Tagged
    
* ✅ Connected
    
* ✅ Budgeted
    
* ✅ Governed
    

---

## 🧱 What Goes Into a Vended Subscription?

Here’s the checklist I follow (and what our vending process automates):

1. **RBAC setup**
    
    * Owner, Contributor, Reader groups mapped to Azure AD groups
        
2. **Policy enforcement**
    
    * Allowed regions, required tags, deny public IPs
        
3. **Subscription tagging**
    
    * Cost center, project name, environment, owner
        
4. **Budget + alerts**
    
    * Based on what the team inputs (not a hard stop, just awareness)
        
5. **Defender for Cloud**
    
    * Enabled by default
        
6. **Optional networking**
    
    * Pre-peered VNets, subnets, NSGs if the project requires connectivity

## ⚙️ Our Vending Machine Setup

Let me walk you through how we built our **subscription vending machine** using **Terraform** and **Azure DevOps**. The goal was to give teams secure, policy-compliant Azure subscriptions in under 20 minutes—without needing manual setup.

This is still evolving, but here's how it works right now:

### 🟢 1. Intake Form (Power Apps)

Teams request a landing zone through a simple **Power Apps form**. It collects:

* Subscription name / purpose
    
* Environment (Dev, QA, Prod)
    
* Budget estimate
    
* Tags (project, owner, cost center, etc.)
    
* Whether networking is needed
    
* Azure AD group for admin access
    

---

### 🟠 2. JSON Configuration File

The form submission generates a **JSON file** with all the inputs. This becomes the **source of truth** for that subscription request.

We keep it structured like this:

```json
jsonCopyEdit{
  "name": "lz-data-prod",
  "managementGroup": "Production",
  "tags": {
    "project": "data-platform",
    "costCenter": "1234",
    "environment": "Prod"
  },
  "IAM": {
    "groupAdmins": ["data-admins@company.com"]
  },
  "budget": 1000,
  "networking": {
    "required": true,
    "vnetName": "vnet-data",
    "addressPrefix": ["10.10.0.0/16"]
  }
}
```

---

### 🔵 3. Azure DevOps Pipelines + Terraform

We have two Azure DevOps pipelines:

---

#### 🚀 a. `lz-provisioning` pipeline

This pipeline runs Terraform to:

* ✅ Assign the subscription to a **management group**
    
* ✅ Apply **tags** from the JSON file
    
* ✅ Enable **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**
    
* ✅ Create a **budget** and configure **alerts**
    
* ✅ Assign **RBAC roles** (e.g., Reader, Contributor, Owner) to Azure AD groups
    
* ✅ Enable **just-in-time access** via PIM (Privileged Identity Management)
    

We use Terraform resources like:

```yaml
hclCopyEdit# Tags
resource "azurerm_subscription_policy_assignment" "tags" { ... }

# Defender for Cloud
resource "azurerm_security_center_subscription_pricing" "defender" {
  resource_type = "VirtualMachines"
  tier          = "Standard"
}

# Budget
resource "azurerm_consumption_budget_subscription" "budget" {
  amount = 1000
  time_grain = "Monthly"
  ...
}

# RBAC
resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "reader" {
  role_definition_name = "Reader"
  principal_id         = var.ad_group_object_id
  scope                = "/subscriptions/${var.subscription_id}"
}
```

---

#### 🌐 b. `lz-networking` pipeline

If networking is required, this pipeline:

* Deploys **Virtual Networks** and **subnets**
    
* Assigns **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** to subnets
    
* Peers the VNet to our central **Virtual WAN hub**
    
* Enables **flow logs** to Log Analytics for visibility
    

These resources are also defined in **Terraform modules**, and all input is taken from the same JSON config file.

---

### 📦 Code Structure

Our Terraform modules and pipelines are cleanly organized like this:

```plaintext
bashCopyEdit/terraform/
  ├── subscription/
  │   ├── tags.tf
  │   ├── rbac.tf
  │   ├── defender.tf
  │   ├── budget.tf
  └── networking/
      ├── vnet.tf
      ├── nsg.tf
      ├── flowlogs.tf
```

We keep everything **modular**, so we can mix and match components as needed.

Optionally, a second pipeline sets up networking using a modular Bicep approach (with VNets, NSGs, peering to a hub, etc.).
